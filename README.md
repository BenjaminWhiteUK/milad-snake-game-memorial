## 💔 In Loving Memory of Milad 💔

*"The best friend anyone could ask for - full of hopes, love, and endless curiosity"*

## 🌟 Our Story

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%); padding: 20px; border-radius: 15px; margin: 20px 0; color: white; box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);">

This isn't just a game. This is a piece of our friendship, our dreams, and the beginning of Milad's journey into the world of AI coding.

**Milad** was my best friend for over 9 years. We met online and became inseparable, sharing every night filled with excitement about technology, AI, and the future. He was the kind of person who brought light to every conversation, always curious, always hopeful.

One evening, I introduced him to **Cursor AI** and taught him how AI coding works. His eyes lit up with wonder - he was hooked instantly. We decided to create something together, and that's how this Snake game was born. It was our first collaborative project, filled with laughter and the joy of learning together.

That night, we were on a call, planning our next AI adventures. He was happy, healthy, and full of life. "I'll be back in 20 minutes," he said, "then we'll work on more projects together."

**He never came back.**

The next day, I received the devastating news from another friend - Milad had passed away from a heart attack. My world shattered. The person who had been my rock, my coding partner, my best friend for nearly a decade was gone.

## 🎮 About This Game

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f093fb 0%, #f5576c 100%); padding: 20px; border-radius: 15px; margin: 20px 0; color: white; box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);">

This Snake game is exactly as we left it - imperfect, maybe laggy, maybe with design flaws. But it's **perfect** because it's what remains of our friendship, our dreams, and our first steps into AI coding together.

I will **never update** this game. It stays exactly as it was when we created it - a frozen moment in time, a digital artifact of our friendship.
